    text: Wow, CareSpooter has been a blessing. We were looking for a specific aid to take care of my father in law in Panama! Dad was so happy, she treats him with patience, kindness, and dignity, and she does everything with a smile. Having her has lifted a tremendous burden for my family, especially for my mother in law who feels like her life was renewed. One behalf of my entire family, thank you CareSpotter from the bottom of our hearts!

    text: My sincere thanks to CareSpotter for coming to our 11th hour rescue. We had very specific needs regarding the caregiver we were looking for, and the caregiver we found through your site was a gem, professional, always on time, and her manner and demeanor showed her many years of experience as an expert caregiver. She was dependable, calm, caring and trustworthy, and we loved her sense of humor. She was a real hero to my grandmother and our family. Thank you CareSpotter!

    text: I have to admit that I was at my wits end until I found CareSpotter. My mother, Molly, who is 95 years old had fallen and broken a hip, and had ended up on a respirator. I was left scrambling to care for my mother and was missing work almost every day. Finally I found CareSpotter, and my mom and I were able to find two amazing caregivers. They're the best, they keep the house immaculate, take care of mom's every need, encourage and even amuse her. Until now I had started to feel like a prisoner in my mother's home, but with my newfound freedom, I have been able to return to work, and have much brighter outlook on my mother's situation.
