It makes me happy with myself being able to take on the responsibility of caring for another life aside from the ones I take care of on a daily basis. In-order for a person to take on the task of caring for someone else, you have to be able to care for yourself, the way i see it if you can't/don't care for yourself, then you can't provide care for the next. \"Treat people how you want to be treated\" at the end of the day you should rest easy and peacefully all because you took on the major responsibility to care for someone that's unable and who depends on you."

But it set me on the path to care-giving as a profession. I'm now proud to be a California registered Certified Nurse Assistant, eager to put what I've learned in service to the elderly in my community. I have a free-flowing affinity for this kind of work... patience, compassion, empathy, honesty and a sincere desire to make life better for those I serve, as well as the knowledge and skill needed to do the job. There's something magical about connecting so personally with another human being in a way that has them appreciating your being there. It's this aspect that, I think, makes being a caregiver the best job in the world. As a former high school teacher of ED (Emotionally Disturbed) kids, I found the above attributes essential in getting my students to trust me and buy into the learning process. I'm not a great multi-tasker. So I like the idea of focusing on one client at time, concentrating my energy and efforts. My ideal job would be live_in four, sometimes five days a week, 2 or 3 clients who are \"good people\", while earning an excellent living wage."

    experiences_description: "Personal Assistant/Caregiver Belvedere-Tiburon I take care of Peter who has Parkinson's and Dementia. He is wheel-chair bound and so I do transfers, change him, bathe him, prepare his meals and do laundry, drive him to appointments and bring him to the dog-park almost everyday. Barbara his wife is ambulatory and can pretty much take care of herself although I cook and clean the house and do the laundry for both of them. I also pay their bills and help them with their banking and correspondence. Peter has since passed away in August 2013 and since then I am now taking care of his widow, Barbara."
