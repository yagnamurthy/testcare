    <b><p>What is CareSpotter? </p></b>

    <p>CareSpotter is not an agency. CareSpotter is a site that helps you work as an independent, professional caregiver and connect with families directly. At CareSpotter, you can set your own rate for services and choose which families you want to work with and which you don't. </p>

    <p>At CareSpotter, caregivers are earning between $12 and $15/hr working directly with families. We want you to be a successful independent caregiver, but we also expect that you represent yourself professionally and responsibly on the site. </p>
