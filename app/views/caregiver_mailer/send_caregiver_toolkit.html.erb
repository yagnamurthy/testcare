<p>Thank you for applying for a care job on CareSpotter. We are dedicated to helping you develop your business as an independent caregiver, and I'm sending you a list of interview questions to ask the family if you are chosen for an interview. Interviewing the family is very important to determine if they are the right client for you, and to make sure you fully understand the scope of the job/requirements. We are happy to assist you with the interview process in any way you would like as well.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact me directly at <a href="tel:407-792-4697" value="+14077924697" target="_blank">407-792-4697</a> or this email. Thank you, and good luck!</p>
