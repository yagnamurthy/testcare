                    "There's no way I would have found my mom's caregiver without CareSpotter! The process has allowed me to have the freedom, confidence and peace of mind that not only have I found a caregiver for my mom, but found a great companion. When I come to visit, my mom's hair and make are done and she looks fantasitic. They have a great relationshipo and the caregiver has really taken a personal interest in her. I couldn't be happier.
