        <p>We may disclose the personal and non-personal information of our customers to any successor-in-interest of ours, such as a company that acquires our business.

We encourage you to take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal and non-personal information, we assume no liability for any disclosure of such data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other acts of third parties, or other acts or omissions.</p>
